Public IAS Classification Framework
===================================

A set of ROS nodes and command line tools for a simple to use classification
framework for robotics applications. Apart from an interface to common
classifiers, it also contains tools for ensemble learning and hashing.

The focus is on RGBD data, and at the moment the following features are
supported: Spin Images, VFH, PFH, FPFH and SHOT, with more being being
enabled soon.

We switched to HDF5 file format for storage, that can be easily manipulated
using Matlab/Octave/Weka for example. Currently SVM, KNN and boosting is
supported, usable either through command line tools or C++.

We are currently in the process of porting the beta code into its final
form, fine-tuning the tools, creating examples and preparing for the first
release.
