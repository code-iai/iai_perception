TCLAP is a small, flexible library that provides a simple interface for
defining and accessing command line arguments. It was intially inspired by
the user friendly CLAP libary. The difference is that this library is
templatized, so the argument class is type independent. Type independence
avoids identical-except-for-type objects, such as IntArg, FloatArg, and
StringArg. While the library is not strictly compliant with the GNU or POSIX
standards, it is close.

TCLAP is written in ANSI C++ and is meant to be compatible with any
standards-compliant C++ compiler. It is known to work on Linux, MacOS X,
Windows, and Solaris platforms. The library is implemented entirely in
header files making it easy to use and distribute with other software. It is
licensed under the MIT License for worry free distribution.
